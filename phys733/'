\section{Massive Dirac Fermion Model}
The dispersion relation $E(k_x, k_y)$ looks like a cone.

New band touching,
we get Dirac fermion
\begin{align}
    H &=
    \int d^2 x\,
    \Psi^\dagger\left(
        -i\sigma^x v_x D_x
        - i\sigma^y D_y
        + m\sigma^z
    \right)\Psi
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
    D_j &= \partial_j - i A_j
\end{align}
We can rescale space to get isotropic velocity
\begin{align}
    y \to \frac{v_y}{v_x}y
\end{align}

In the Lagrangian formulation
\begin{align}
    S &= \int d^3x\, \mathcal{L}
\end{align}
the lagrangian density is
\begin{align}
    \mthcal{L} &=
    \overline{\Psi} \left( i \slash{D} - m \right) \Psi
\end{align}
where we use Feynman slash notation
\begin{align}
    \slash{D} = \gamma^{\mu}D_{\mu}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
    \overline{\Psi} &= \Psi^\dagger \gamma^0
\end{align}
and the Dirac matrices here are
\begin{align}
    \gamma^0 &= \sigma^z\\
    \gamma^1 &= i \sigma^x\\
    \gamma^2 &= i\sigma^y.
\end{align}
In continuum,
can also define on curved space-time a metric $g_{\mu\nu}$
with action
\begin{align}
    S &= \int d^3x\,
    \sqrt{|g|} \mathcal{L}
\end{align}
where you can diagonalzie the metric with orthonormal frame fields
\begin{align}
    g_{\mu\nu}^a \eta_{\alpha\beta} e_{\nu}^b
\end{align}
and we use the Minkowski metric
\begin{align}
    \eta &=
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & &\\
        & -1 &\\
        & & -1
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
The group of transformations which leaves the metric invariant is
$SO(2, 1)$, which means there is a redundancy in this description,
as transformations like
\begin{align}
    e_{\mu}^a \to \sum_{b} W_{ab} e_\mu^b
\end{align}
where $W\in SO(2,1)$ describe the same thing.
This gauge symmetry leads to a $SO(2, 1)$
non-abelian gauge field
\begin{align}
    W_\mu^{ab}
\end{align}
which is also called the ``spin connection''.
The holomony of this gauge filed will tell you how you wind up rotated as you go
in a closed loop.
It tells you how to do parallel transport in your space to relate frame fields to
each other in different points in space.

So the field strength of the spin connection will then give you the curvature of
spacetime.

The way you couple Dirac fermions to space-time curvature is to couple them to
this non-Abelian gauge field,
the spin connection.

\begin{question}
    What was the redundancy?
    If $W$ is just a redundancy,
    how can it define a field?
\end{question}
When you have $U(1)$ gauge symmetry,
you have
\begin{align}
    \psi \to e^{i\theta} \psi
\end{align}
Then we gauge the global symmetry.

\begin{question}
    Although it's called spin connection,
    it seems only related to the $SO(2, 1)$ spacetime,
    but not the field that lives on the spacetime?
\end{question}
What you're alluding to will come up next,
how to couple the field to the Dirac spinor,
during which we must pick a representation,
and we have to pick the spinor representation.

\begin{question}
    How will we be gauging this?
    These are local transformations to begin with,
    do we need to gauge them?
\end{question}
It's like turning on gravity.
When you turn on $g$,
you have curved spacetime,
and to describe it,
it's turning on a gauge field associated with $SO(2, 1)$.
It gives a way of thinking of curvature as an ordinary gauge term,
of $SO(2,1)$ in this case.

\begin{question}
    If you want your theory to be invariant,
    there should be some cancellation of fermionic field,s
    and since the field is present,
    it can demonstrate the curvature of spacetime.c
    But sine the $W$ is just a local Lorentz transformation,
    it doesn't carry.
\end{question}
I'm not spelling this out,
I'm just sketching the general thing.
just to see what fields are involved in the description.
So fermions should couple to this gauge field $W_\mu^{ab}$.
So the covariant derivative $D_\mu \psi_\alpha$.

The spinor should be written as
\begin{align}
    \Psi =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \psi_1\\
        \psi_2
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
and then we want to couple to the gauge field the following way.
\begin{align}
    D_{\mu}\psi_\alpha &=
    \left( \partial_\mu - iA_\mu \right)\psi_\alpha
    + \frac{1}{2} W_\mu^{ab}\left( S_{ab} \right)_{\alpha\beta}\psi_\beta
\end{align}
where the $S_{ab}$ is the spinor representation of the Lorentz group,
can be written in terms of Gamma matrices.

So now we can consider integrating out the fermions.

By integrating out the fermions,
I mean we do something like this.
\begin{align}
    e^{iS_{\mathrm{eff}}[A,W]} &=
    \int \mathcal{D}\overline{\Psi}\,\mathcal{D}\Psi\,
    e^{iS[\Psi, A, W]}.
\end{align}
It will be homework,
but the point  is,
to lowest order,
you get Chern-Simons terms.
\begin{align}
    S_{\mathrm{eff}} &=
    \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{\sgn(m)}{2}
    \int \epsilon^{\mu\nu\lambda} A_\mu \partial_\nu A_\lambda
    + \frac{\sgn(m)}{2} S_{\mathrm{CS,grav}}
\end{align}
where the second term is the gravitational Chern-Simons term for the non-Abelian
gauge field.

And this term is
\begin{align}
    S_{\mathrm{CS,grav}} \propto
    \int\Tr\left( w\wedge dw + \frac{2}{3} w\wedge w \wedge w \right).
\end{align}
Changing the sign of the mass gives
\begin{align}
    \Delta S &= \frac{1}{4\pi} \int A\, dA
    + S_{\mathrm{CS,grav}}
\end{align}
The point of this was to see what the effective action is from the point of view
of the Dirac fermions and see how we can reproduce the
$A_\mu \partial_\nu A_\lambda$
Chern-Simons term and that we also get this over gravitational term.

Every time we describe topological phases with free Fermions,
there's always some way to also describe it in terms of Majorana fermions
or Dirac fermion.

Now we have a Dirac fermion of 2+1D and we can chase the phase we're in by
changing the mass.
The same thing happens in other dimensinos,
and by chnagin the msas term,
you can go thorugh different topological phases.

\subsection{Chiral fermion on domain wall in mass}
If you have a system with boundaryies,
you can have chiral fermion modes.
Because changing the sign of the mass chnages the Chern number,
because it changes the effective action by one unit of the CS term.
It turns out,
at the domain wall,
we're going to have exponentially localized to the domain wall,
that's gapless and chiral.
Let $m(x)$ is negative for negative $x$ and positive for positive $x$.
It reduces to the Jakiw-Rabbi soliton in 1D.
The Hamiltonian is
\begin{align}
    H &=
    \int dx\, dy\,
    \Psi^\dagger\left(
        -i\sigma^x \partial_x - i\sigma^y \partial_y + m(x) \sigma^z
    \right)
\end{align}
where I set the velociities to 1.

For a plane wave
\begin{align}
    \Psi(x, y) &= \Psi(x) e^{ik_x y},
\end{align}
the eigenvalue equation is
\begin{align}
    \left( -i\sigma^x \partial_x + m(x) \sigma^z \right)\psi
    &=
    \left( E_{k_y} - k_y \sigma^y \right)\psi.
\end{align}
If you remember what we did in the Jakiv-rabbi Soliton,
there was a zero-energy solution where
$E_{k_y} + k_y \sigma^x$ was the solution
and it was exponentially localized to the domain wall.

Recall in the J-R soliton,
there is a $z$ mode solution $\psi_0$
with
\begin{align}
    \sigma^x \psi_0 = \lambda \psi_0
\end{align}
where $\lambda = \pm 1$.
This zero-energy solution means that we get a solution localized to the domain
wall with an energy
\begin{align}
    E_{k_y} &= -\lambda k_y.
\end{align}
If we hada domain wall hwere $m(x)<0$ on one side
but $m(x)>0$ on the other side, 
we have a propagatiting fermion exponentially confined to the domain wall.

We have a chiral anomaly and a graviational anomaly,
which is partially responsible for a quantized thermal quantum hall effect.

The $(1+1)D$ chiral fermion has a
$U(1)$ chiral anomaly,
which is a t' Hooft anomaly.
There is also a graviataionl anomaly.
Both of these anomalies can be cancelled by the
$(2+1)D$ bulk,
which is the Chern insulator.
This is an exammple
of how you have anomalies in one dimesion,
but are cancelled in higher dimensions.
related to this isthe fac that the chiral fermion is gives a quantized thermal
hall conductance.

The gravitational anomaly and the quantized thermal Hall conductance
defines a chiral central charge $C_{-}$.
It is the same as the Chern number for free fermion systems,
but that breaks down for interactiing systems.

If you view them as boundaries of a Chern insulator,
there's no longer anything wrong with the anomalies.
